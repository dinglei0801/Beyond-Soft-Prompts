{"sentence": "we have two of these gates that we use to contain the babies ( 15 mo . and 4 mo . ) in the living room and to keep the dog out of the living room .   easily installed and adjustable .   we have n't had to use any extensions .   15 mo . old ca n't open it but 6 yr . old nephew can operate it easily on his own .   we are buying a third one of these to keep the 15 mo . old out of the laundry room .   they are wonderful !", "label": "3", "class_name": "baby"}
{"sentence": "i have researched every gate on the market at this point .   so far we are extremely happy with this gate .   we wanted pressure mounted gates but i was concerned that the opening of this particular gate would not be wide enough for my husband .   i thought that he would have to turn sideways to get through the door and would not like it once used on a regular basis .   so far we are very satisfied customers and my husband can walk straight through the opening so the width meets our needs better than i anticipated .", "label": "3", "class_name": "baby"}
{"sentence": "we got this gate because we recently got 2 puppies , and have gated off all areas of our house so that they do n't run all around the house causing havoc . however regular gates are such a pain , having to step over them , is a hassle . especially while trying to carry a new baby . so this is great . only complaints : i wish the opening was larger , it is n't huge- but to be fair , the description does give dimensions . the only other thing that is taking a while to get used to , is there is a bar at the bottom of the gate- even in the opening , so you still have to watch your step , but it is less of a hassle than having to take down gates or step over them . overall , i would recommend .", "label": "3", "class_name": "baby"}
{"sentence": "i really really like this gate . my 19 year old grandson put it up for me as a means of keeping our dog limited to a certain area of our house , and to keep the grandkids in a more controlled area as well . it was easy to install and so far seems to be holding up very well . my only concern is whether it will last over time because we get so much traffic in our house and you do have to use a good bit of & # 34;push&#34 ; to release and open the gate each time .   but overall , at this point , we love it !", "label": "3", "class_name": "baby"}
{"sentence": "we got this style because we did n't want to attach hardware to our door frames . the step is now noisy , which i may be able to fix with some wd40 or something , but i just have n't tried yet . we also have another gate that is a slightly different the first years model than this . i like that that one has the plastic guard at the bottom to act as a transition . i 've kicked the bottom bar while going through many times ! the opening of this gate is also slightly narrower than the other gate . this one is also a little taller . overall it does the job , but if i had to purchase again i would buy the other first years model instead .", "label": "3", "class_name": "baby"}
{"sentence": "there are so many pros , so few cons to this gate .   it 's tall , there 's no way my 2-year - old can get over it .   incredibly convenient swinging door .   if you follow the instructions on how to correctly tighten it on the door frame you wo n't have trouble .   i did n't do that the first time and i was getting frustrated .   the gate was smarter than me!my son , who is mr. motor skills , can not open it . would make an excellent dog gate for small dogs . sometimes the pedal can get sticky and you have to push on it a little harder , but that 's really my only complaint .", "label": "3", "class_name": "baby"}
{"sentence": "this gate is really a great product . i love the fact that you do n't have to hardware mount the gate ( no drilling into the doorways required ) , and it 's still very sturdy . it was incredibly easy to install , and is very safe and secure . my 18 month son knows how the gate opens , but can not open it because of the weight required to push down on the lever . the only negatives i encountered were:1 ) the first hands free gate i purchased was not painted properly , so i had to return it for another one.2 ) i had to buy the 5&quot ; gate extension for the gate to fit in the doorway . so , in the end , there are additional costs if the opening you intend to use the gate for is not that narrow . but all in all , it 's totally worth it .", "label": "3", "class_name": "baby"}
{"sentence": "the gate is decent construction , and the lever has enough weight where only an adult can open it .   the mounts are n't sturdy . this gate only fits in our doorways , and this is with the extensions maxed - out to their maximum length .   this does n't make for a secure fit in our doorways , and it is unusable anywhere else .   it 's too small .   it fits soundly in doors less than 30&#34 ; in width , so measure your doorway before you buy . the mounts do not securely fasten onto the gate , so when you move it from doorway to doorway or when installing , these fall out of the gate , and you have to balance these during installation . yes , there are extensions available , but these are sold as an accessory , and with the combined cost , there are other better options available . i do n't recommend this product as we replaced it with a simpler , lower - cost solution . save yourself .", "label": "3", "class_name": "baby"}

{"sentence": "i was fortunate to find two of these gates with two extensions each at a second hand baby store for 20 dollars each .   after the first year with my newborn , i 've come to need a coupe more gates .   i have tried 4 other similar ones and quickly sent them back .   these ones are a little more expensive , but i 've found that after being spoiled with the foot opening contraption of these gates , i simply can not live without that feature in another gate .   i do need the extensions , which makes it more expensive , so i will be purchasing two more of these in the very near future ! !", "label": "3", "class_name": "baby"}
{"sentence": "our little one is rolling and starting to crawl , so we bought two of these gates , one for the top of our walk - up stairs , and one for the hallway .   they are fantastic .   you have to do two things to open the gate -- push down on the foot pedal while pushing the gate forward , but because you can do these without your hands , it is perfect for when you are carrying your little one in your arms .   the foot pedal also requires a substantial push , so there is no way that the   baby ( or a pet ) would be able to do so on his or her own .   the material is very sturdy , so even if a toddler tried to pull herself up on the gate , it would not come undone .   the gate door also works both ways , an important feature . the one negative as far as i can tell is that when coming up the stairs , it takes a little extra coordination to step on the foot pedal . definitely recommended .", "label": "3", "class_name": "baby"}
{"sentence": "i love this gate and would buy it again . i like how it swings open both ways , opens with a foot pedal so it 's hands free , and is incredibly sturdy though it 's pressure - mounted . my only disappointment with this gate is that it does n't fit well on our stairs . we live in a small apartment and the wall does n't jut out far enough from the bottom step in order for the foot pedal to work . instead , i mounted the gate in the doorway of our baby 's nursery , and it is working out great .", "label": "3", "class_name": "baby"}

{"sentence": "i absolutely love this gate .   we were going to get two , but only got one to make sure we 'd like it .   we did n't want to drill any holes and our gate sits at the bottom of the stairs just like in the pictures , only on the floor not the first step .   it 's great .   all four points where the gate touches the wall are different depth and i also used the extension kit and it works perfectly .   it is very stable and my little boy ca n't open it or pull it down . i 'm about to order another one for the top of the stairs .", "label": "3", "class_name": "baby"}
{"sentence": "easy to use , easy to install and it has so many different options of installation ( extensions , y - spindles , stairway adaptors ) and all were easy to figure out . even my 60 plus mother said it was easy to figure out how to use it without any instruction . really liked how the bottom \" supports \" that press against the wall were flat on the bottom edge so they lay against the floor better . my other brand of gate did nt have that . only complaint was my box had no directions in it . but managed without them .", "label": "3", "class_name": "baby"}
{"sentence": "we bought this gate a few months ago .   it 's generally well made and is sturdier than some other gates .   overall , it 's a good choice , although in my opinion it is a bit overpriced .   an appropriate price for the quality would be around $ 50.pros:-adjustable size - door swings both in both directions - door is pretty easy to open - pressure - mounted ( no damage to walls)cons:-you have to lift the door as you open it .   this gets to be a bit of a pain - not as sturdy as a hardware - mounted gate ... it loosens over time so you do need to take minute to tighten it up periodically . other reviewers have commented that the bar across the bottom is annoying .   i actually find it to be fine .   you do have to step over it , but it 's only about 1 \" so it does n't bother me . i will update this review when my baby starts walking ... i 'm hoping that the pressure mount will be strong enough to hold up to a toddler !", "label": "3", "class_name": "baby"}

{"sentence": "this gate is much better than most on the market . the design allows it to function well as a gate , yet allowing foot traffic through by the inclusion of a lockable door in the unit . the gate is made of metal , but i deducted 1 star due to the locking mechanism being made of plastic . only time will tell how much real - world use it will stand up to . another thing about this gate that i like is the flexibility offered by the availability of extensions -- it is possible to mount this gate pretty much anywhere needed . overall , i am happy with this purchase .", "label": "3", "class_name": "baby"}
