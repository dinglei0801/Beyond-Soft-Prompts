{"sentence": "sally potter gives a truly wonderful performance as the woman who becomes almost mezmerized by the dance .   she learns the very traditional tango from a young argentine dancer . traditional tango is an extremely sexual , sensual dance where the man goes through the steps of seducing and controlling his partner 's every move . remember , the argentine tango has it 's roots in the brothels of argentina and for many years was banned in polite society . by the time the tango reached north america it had gained respectability and risen to a true art dance form . in this film sally porter begins to assert the role of a modern liberated woman who is no longer content to be completely directed and controled by the man . her partner is at first dismayed and angry that she wants to assert herself and their dancing becomes more and more like a battle . the tango becomes a metaphor for a woman 's struggle for equality . the dancing alone is enough to highly recommend this film . the underlying ideas just make it that much better .", "label": "15", "class_name": "movies and tv"}
